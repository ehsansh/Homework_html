	<p><b>Question</b>: Is &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; a tag?</p>
	<p>
		No this is not a tag that is why it start with ! and <br />
		HTML is not its attribute and it does not have any value
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Question:</b> What happens if we do not determine attribute of the meta tag?
	</p>
	<p>Our browser could not open some special languages</p>

	<p>
		<b>Question</b>How could we write spaces in our paragraphs?<br />
		That is very simple we should write nbs between & and ; now I add 5<br />
		spaces here see how it works &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; YOu see how<br />
		it works now?
